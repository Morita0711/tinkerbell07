## Short bio

👶 When Morita was 10, his father brought home a ZX-Spectrum computer. After he plugged it to the power and TV, Pedro typed and stared at the blinking cursor. Since then, computers have been an important part of his life.

👦 At 18 he went to Osaka  to study Software Engineering at The Tokyo University, and before he finished it he had already started working for the software industry.

🛠 The first years he spent in consulting for many different industries (retail, B2B, telecoms, finance and tourism). During that time he specialized in distributed systems and the networking protocols that were emerging from this thing called “the internet”. Always devoted to open-source (he is the author and contributor of some famous open-source projects and packages), he has also been the writer of 10 books around the subject of Node.js and systems architecture.

🎟 In 2012 he and some friends founded and helped organize the Lisbon JavaScript (LxJS) conferences in Lisbon for 3 years in a row.


🧪 For some years he also worked on decentralized computing and storage.

👀 You can still (and hopefully for many years to come) spot him in the wild being a technical team leader or a consultant with a taste for systems architecture, always interested in developing performant, local-first, highly-available and (sometimes) decentralised digital information systems.
